            <p>Be Your Own Boss: You set your own schedule, rules, and direction, removing the need to answer to a
                superior.<br><br>
                Freedom to Create: It allows you to transform your innovative ideas into a tangible product or service.<br><br>
                Unlimited Potential: Income and rewards are not capped by a salary; high risk often brings higher
                potential for financial gain.<br><br>
                Passion-Driven Purpose: It is often driven by a need to solve problems and make a personal, positive
                impact.<br><br>
                Constant Growth: You learn, develop, and adapt rapidly, turning every mistake into a valuable lesson.<br><br>
                High Risk, High Reward: It is a "rollercoaster" of emotions; the path is often lonely and requires
                intense dedication (sometimes 65+ hours a week).<br><br>
                Mindset Over Career: It is more of a mindset or psychological predisposition than just a job.<br><br>
                Immediate Action: True entrepreneurs do not wait for the perfect time; they "start before they are
                ready"</p>
